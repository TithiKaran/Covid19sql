### Covvid19 Data Analysis Using SQL
## Project Overview:
The COVID-19 Data Analysis project aims to extract meaningful insights from datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project utilizes SQL queries to explore, analyze, and visualize key metrics such as daily
new deaths, vaccinations, population percentages, and more. By combining information from different tables, aggregating data, and applying time series analysis, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and over time.
## Project Objectives:
# Data Import:
   Load COVID-19 datasets into the database tables.
# Basic Exploration:
  Explore the structure of the tables, examining columns and data types.
  Display sample rows from each table to get an initial understanding of the data.
# Joining Tables:
  Combine information from the covid_deaths and covid_vaccination tables using appropriate SQL JOIN operations.
# Aggregation:
  Calculate summary statistics such as total deaths and vaccinations by continent.
# Time Series Analysis:
  Analyze trends in daily new deaths and vaccinations over time.
# Rolling Aggregations:
  Calculate rolling averages or sums to identify patterns and trends.
# Percentages and Ratios:
  Calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated in different locations.
# Data Filtering:
 Identify countries with the highest death rates and explore their vaccination status.
# Subqueries:
 Use subqueries to nest and organize complex analyses.
# Visualization (Optional):
 If tools like Power BI or R are available, consider visualizing key findings using charts or graphs.
# Data Sources:
The project uses datasets related to COVID-19, including daily death reports (covid_deaths) and vaccination records (covid_vaccination) from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.
